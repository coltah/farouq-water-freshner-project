    <p><b>
For the past two years,water around Mahio area has been very dirty,this has led to many people around the area loosing lives due to deadly pandemics caused by pollution.
This led to development of Farouq water freshner to help solve water problems.The project of the company is to have machines collect polythenes from water sources.
The chemicals to be used also to clean water are enviromentally friendly and make water suit for consumption.
The company will also have the vehicles to help reach families that far away from water sources.There are also tanks that contain fresh water,also taps have treated water.

The water animals which result to diseases will be killed to avoid there spread.
The project is to help have a healthy community which will be strong.
It also allows people to use water even if just from boreholes since purification is done in every source of water.
The project will gain popularity since it is located in the area where people didn't have knowledge concerning how to clean water.
